            <h2>My Name is David Power, and I am a recent graduate.</h2>
            <p>I recently graduated from Trinity College Dublin with a bachelors degree in Computer Science, Linguistics and Irish. I have a keen interest in programming, computational linguistics, database management and software engineering. I am also interested in web and app development, and have been taking courses on Lynda.com in these areas. I would love to get some experience working in any of these areas and further developing my skills.

            <h2>Science Gallery Mediator</h2>
            <p>I developed excellent interpersonal and communication skills as a SGD mediator, conveying complex scientific concepts to general public in an interdisciplinary space through tours and one on one interactions.
I delivered hands-on technical workshops in soldering and electronics for adults and children at Science Gallery's MakeShop.</p><p> I had to be a flexible and responsive team-player working in dynamic environments to facilitate diverse events in the Science Gallery and off site, for example TED X Dublin. </p>

            <h2>Trinity College Dublin</h2>
            <p>Throughout the three years that I studied in Trinity (1st, 2nd and 4th year) I covered a diverse range of subjects. These included Irish language and grammar, discrete mathematics, statistics, Java programming, syntax, semantics, natural language processing and more!</p>
                <p>I also participated heavily in the Cumman Gaelach (The Irish Society), attending weekly meetings and going to the Oireachtas each year, as well as the VDP (The Volunteering Society), acting in a Christmas Panto, helping children at weekly homework clubs and attending Inspirational weekends away.</p>

            <h2>University of Glasgow</h2>
            <p>Throughout my Erasmus year I studied the same core subjects except with Scots Gaelic in place of Irish. I also completed a dissertation whilst on Erasmus on creating a morphological analyser for Scots Gaelic verbs.</p>
                <p>The entire exchange was a great experience and learning adventure especially in terms of independence. I played an active role in the student television society, GUST, attending weekly studios and meetings. I was involved in the Cumman Oiseanach (The Gaelic Society) as well as in the Pole Dancing club.</p>

            <h2>Final Year Project</h2>
            <p>For my final year project, I created a functioning corpus based scrabble application. An application where the user (or player) could choose to either play Scrabble in English, Irish or any language they wanted so long as they had a corpus text file of that language. The application would take such a corpus, redistribute the values associated with letters and the frequency with which they occur in the game, and use the corpus as the dictionary in the game stored as a Trie data structure. I received a First Class Honours for this project.

            <h2>Erasmus Dissertation</h2>
            <p>For my Erasmus Dissertation I designed and implemented a morphological transducer for the verbs in Scottish Gaelic using the Xerox Finite State Tool, XFST. I received a First Class Honours for this dissertation and the report, which contains the code in it's appendix, is viewable here - <a  href="images/WholeDissertation.pdf" title="Erasmus Dissertation" target="_blank"> Link</a> </p>
