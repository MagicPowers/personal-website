    <h2>Tupac Shakur</h2>
    <p>Tupac spent most of his days giving back to the community. A self proclaimed rose growing from the cracks in the cement, Tupac was well aware of his negative aspects, but believed that his positive aspects and actions spoke volumes given the environment he grew up in.</p>
    
    <h2>Rick Sanchez</h2>
    <p>Considered to have a Laisez Faire attitude towards safety when it comes to Scientific breakthroughs, Rick lets no one get in the way of his intergalactic hijinks. Often portraying himself as a man who doesn't care about anything, Rick actually appears to be a leading member in a revolutionary organisation attempting to overthrow the seemingly dictator-like galactic government.</p>
    
    <h2>Mr Meeseeks</h2>
    <p>Having one true goal in life is admirable, and no goals are more admirable than those that intend to help others. Mr Meeseeks devote their entire existence to helping someone attain or achieve a certain goal.</p>
    
    <h2>Mordin Solus</h2>
    <p>The perfect model of a Scientist Salarian, Mordin Solus knows true sacrafice. A man who battles daily with his philisophical understandings of the universe he is in and the position he has been placed in. His quick calculating mind enable him to make life and death decisions that would shake a normal man to his core, unfortunately the results often end up haunting him.</p>
